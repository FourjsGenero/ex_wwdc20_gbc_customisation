# ex_wwdc20_gbc_customisation
Examples from GBC Customisation Breakout at WWDC 20

* customization folder contains the 9 different customization examples used

* 4gl folder contains the two programs I used other than gwc-demo to demonstrate the changes.  askreuben45 was used in conjunction with the 5_circularimage example.  replace_html was used in conjunciton with the 7_frontcall example

* config shows what custom.json would look like.  custom.json has the entry for 1_empty and you can edit and replace 1_empty with the appropriate example. 2a_red, 2a_green etc.  custom.json.8_theme, custom.json.9_condtheme are what you would copy to custom.json for those 2 examples
